# Journal Progressive Web App

This is a project to explore implentating progressive web apps and explore the trade offs between using different frameworks versus plain old vanilla javascript. This project is in progress. First I'll make a vanilla js implementation, then a version in react, and finally one in angular. Then I'll benchmark performance for each one.
